## Tech Stack

| Layer      | Technology |
|------------|------------|
| Framework  | Next.js 16 (App Router, Server Actions) + React 19 + TypeScript |
| Styling    | Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui-style components |
| Database   | PostgreSQL 14+ (Neon-compatible) via Prisma 7 |
| Auth       | NextAuth v5 (credentials = 6-digit staff access code) |
| Documents  | PDFKit (server-side branded PDFs) |

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A PostgreSQL 14+ database (local, Neon, Supabase or RDS)

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/technic_erp?schema=public"
AUTH_SECRET="<openssl rand -base64 32>"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
APP_NAME="Technic Technologies ERP"
```

### 3. Install, migrate & seed

```bash
npm install
npx prisma migrate deploy     # create all tables
npm run db:seed               # firm, branches, users, catalogue, demo data
```

### 4. Run

```bash
npm run dev                   # development on http://localhost:3000
# or
npm run build && npm start    # production
```

## First Login

Sign in with any seeded staff code, then pick the firm and enter the shop.

| Role | Code |
|------|------|
| Super Admin (full view) | `900001` |
| GST Reconciliation Admin (GST-only view) | `900000` |
| Manager | `900002` |
| Accountant | `900003` |
| Sales Staff | `900004` |
| Purchase Staff | `900005` |
| Inventory Manager | `900006` |
| Sales (branch B) | `900007` |
| Viewer | `900008` |

> **Change or delete these demo codes before going live** (Administration → Users).

The **GST Reconciliation Admin** (`900000`) operates in a GST-only reporting view: non-GST transactions are filtered out of every screen, search, report and export for that user. All other roles see the complete transaction stream. The view is a property of the user record and can be changed by a Super Admin.

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Replace all 8 demo access codes with real staff codes
- [ ] Rotate both firm access codes (they ship in the seed for demo convenience)
- [ ] Set a strong `AUTH_SECRET` and serve over HTTPS
- [ ] Point `NEXTAUTH_URL` at the production domain
- [ ] Schedule `pg_dump` backups (or enable your provider's automated backups)
- [ ] Review role permissions for your staff (default matrix follows the handover spec)

## Useful Scripts

```bash
npm run db:seed        # reset & reseed demo data (clears business tables first)
npm run db:studio      # Prisma Studio data browser
npx tsc --noEmit       # typecheck
```
